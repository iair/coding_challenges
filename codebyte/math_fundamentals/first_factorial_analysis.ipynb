    "The built-in `math.factorial()` function in Python is faster than both the iterative and `reduce` approaches because:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Implementation in C**\n",
    "   - `math.factorial()` is part of the Python `math` module, which is written in C, a low-level programming language. C code runs significantly faster than Python code due to its compiled nature and optimizations that are not feasible in pure Python.\n",
    "   - Python’s `math` library, being written in C, executes factorial computations at a speed optimized for performance, without the overhead of Python’s dynamic type-checking and function-call mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Optimized Algorithm**\n",
    "   - The `math.factorial()` function is highly optimized specifically for computing factorials. It likely uses an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of operations, possibly including optimized multiplication techniques or loop unrolling, which reduces the number of times Python must execute each line of code.\n",
    "   - In contrast, the iterative approach and `reduce` with a lambda function perform straightforward multiplication operations without these optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Avoiding Python Overhead**\n",
    "   - Each operation in Python carries some overhead due to the way Python manages memory, data types, and error checking dynamically. This overhead is especially pronounced in Python's `reduce()` function, which adds additional function calls for each step.\n",
    "   - `math.factorial()` sidesteps most of this overhead, performing all the required calculations internally in C, thus avoiding repeated calls to Python’s own operators or functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Memory Efficiency**\n",
    "   - The built-in `math.factorial()` is optimized to handle large numbers efficiently within Python’s arbitrary-precision integer management. This is important because factorial values grow extremely large very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, whenever possible, it’s recommended to use `math.factorial()` for factorial calculations in Python, especially when performance is important."
